XDD Release ChangeLog
-----------------------

xdd-7.0.0 RC7
=============
* ChangeLog file added for changelog information.
* HOWTO file added describing how a release is cut.
* xddcp script updated to work with -e2e style options and fix mis-quote
  in supplied script that launched remote command without focus.
* Add -bytes option to specify any file size for transfer.
* Transfer files of arbitrary sizes (without DIO)
* Fix option handling in xddcp to work correctly and add -s option to DIO
  source side.
* Fix bug in xddcp script so that remote side works a bit (still not fully
  guaranteed to work -- the script kills itself, so xdd processes may still
  exist on remote side).

xdd-7.0.0 RC6
=============
* Randomized reads now work with random offsets.
* xdd_forkthread.sh script included to demonstrate forkthread behavior.
