XDD Release ChangeLog
-----------------------

xdd-7.0.0 RC10
=============
* XDD: Restart supports arbitrary filename
* XDD: Source side restart cookie removed
* XDD: Output less scary (WARNING Root locks pages, etc)
* XDD: Added -dryrun
* XDD: Miscellaneous cleanups
* XDD: Fixed issue that resulted in corrupt data after restarts
* XDDCP: Heatbeat info on source side stdout
* XDDCP: Log files and restart file named consistently
* XDDCP: Destination side log and restart are put int
  same directory as destination file

xdd-7.0.0 RC9
=============
* XDD: Added a -restart option to allow resuming a partial transfer
* XDDCP: Added a -a option to automate the restart/resume process for user
* XDDCP: Added -p portnum option to script
* XDDCP: Remove option that appeared to allow partial file transfers.  It
  didn't do exactly what it said it did, and positional parameters are error prone.
* XDDCP: Explictly documented the host:<path_to_file> format of input.  Its supported,
  if it doesn't work for you, file a bug and we'll fix it.
* XDDCP: Tried to fix trailing message in script (still says 
  "Transfer finished."  when the user explicitly cancels xdd with Ctrl-c.
* XDDCP: Added -F option that allows user to specify transfer files inside
  of the source side file.

xdd-7.0.0 RC8
=============
* -createnewfiles patched to correctly create file sizes over multiple passes
* -dio works on destination side of e2e transfers of files of odd sizes
* fastinstall makefile target added

xdd-7.0.0 RC7
=============
* ChangeLog file added for changelog information.
* HOWTO file added describing how a release is cut.
* xddcp script updated to work with -e2e style options and fix mis-quote
  in supplied script that launched remote command without focus.
* Add -bytes option to specify any file size for transfer.
* Transfer files of arbitrary sizes without DIO.  NOTE:  When DIO is
  enabled, the amount of data to be transferred must be divisible by 4096.
* Fix option handling in xddcp to work correctly and add -s option for DIO
  on the source side.
* Fix bug in xddcp script so that remote side works a bit (still not fully
  guaranteed to work -- the script kills itself, so xdd processes may still
  exist on remote side).
* Include contrib/TEST_xdd_copy.sh, a copy test driver that generates the
  the source, removes existing destination files, and computes the md5sum
  of the resulting files for comparison after transfer.
* Including testing results in tests/output/rc7 subdirectory.

xdd-7.0.0 RC6
=============
* Randomized reads now work with random offsets.
* xdd_forkthread.sh script included to demonstrate forkthread behavior.
