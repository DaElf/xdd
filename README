Build Instructions for Linux and AIX (currently, no other platforms supported).
--

On Linux:
> ./configure
> make
> make install

On AIX (requires the xlc_r compiler):
> ./configure
> gmake
> gmake install

By default, XDD and supporting scripts are installed in /opt/xdd, in order
to change the installation path, use --prefix=<new path> during the configure
step.
