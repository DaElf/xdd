Build Instructions for Linux and AIX (currently, no other platforms supported).
--

On Linux:
> ./configure
> make
> make install

On AIX (requires the xlc_r compiler):
> ./configure
> gmake
> gmake install

By default, XDD and supporting scripts are installed in /opt/xdd, in order
to change the installation path, use --prefix=<new path> during the configure
step.

XFS pre-allocation support
--
File preallocation on end-to-end transfers currently only works for the XFS
file system.  This is mainly because the posix_fallocate call is supported
inconsistently in Linux, and so we are making the direct fctl call in the
case of XFS file systems.  We attempt to enable preallocate on XFS if we can
find the correct headers in the default places.  But if the headers are not
easily locatable then we do not enable XFS preallocation support.  The
configure script controls xfs preallocation with with an explicit enable/disable
flag.  To guarantee that XFS preallocation is enable, use the following:

> ./configure --enable-xfs

To disable XFS preallocation, use the following instead:

> ./configure --disable-xfs

The defaults have been tested on Fedora 12, Scientific Linux, and Suse only.
