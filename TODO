TODO file for XDD

// Next-release
* Add source for gethostip and build if necessary
* Add configure option for --enable-static to perform static builds
* Fix xddcp so that it uses keepalives to hold the SSH session open
	(this is needed because file I/O doesn't occur until close on
	NFS file systems, meaning that a failure isn't known during transfer).
* Detect if the ports required are in use, and if so, adjust the port range
  if possible
* Get xddcp to work on Power7/AIX (needs truncate and gethostip)
* Add option that sets the log path
* Fix log names so the gethostip doesn't obscure log name
* Add output that tells the IP we are going to contact for a name


// General
* Add confidence data dump
* Add serial thread scheduling I/O scheme
* Fix heartbeat percent to display correct percent during a restart

// xddcp
* Third-part transfers
* Multi-host transfers
* Check preconditions for all constituent utilities
* Use utilities available on all SystemV-type OS
* Incorporate seconds into log timestamps
* Indicate interface used for transfer
