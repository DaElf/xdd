This document describes how to cut a release of the XDD software.
--


Before anything else, Tom, Steve, all get the tree to a place where it 
has the features we think it needs.  This includes modifying the CHANGES 
file so that it contains a summary of what new features the tree should 
contain.

Then perform the following steps:

1.  Retrieve the repository:
	> git clone ssh://home.ccs.ornl.gov/ccs/proj/csc040/var/git/xdd.git

2.  Increment the version release number for the build.  Versions 
numbers are in the format MAJOR.MINOR.MAINTENANCE[.PRE-RELEASE].  This 
is the standard convention for most Linux software packaged and publicly 
available:
	> cd xdd
	> vi Makefile # and edit the VERSION variable
	> make baseversion

3.  Test the new features:
	> make
	> ./run_some_tests.sh . . .

4.  If the tests don't pass, we go back to before step 1.  Otherwise, we 
continue cutting the release.

5.  Tag the code.
	> git commit -a	
	> git tag xdd-MAJOR.MINOR.MAINTENANCE[.PRE-RELEASE]

6.  Push everything back up to the durmstrang repository:
	> git push --tags

7.  At this point, the release is ready.  It can be retrieved by anyone with 
    access to the repository.  To retrieve the release, run the following command:
	> git archive --format=tar --prefix=TAG_NAME --remote=ssh://home.ccs.ornl.gov/ccs/proj/csc040/var/git/xdd.git TAG_NAME |gzip > TAG_NAME.tar.gz

    Where TAG_NAME is in the format xdd-MAJOR.MINOR.MAINTENANCE[.PRE-RELEASE] (e.g. xdd-7.0.0.rc1)

The resulting tar file now contains the released code only.
