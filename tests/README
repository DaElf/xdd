To run the acceptance tests for XDD, you must first create a test_config based
on the contents of test_config.example.  Then, simply run:

./run_all_tests.sh

Acceptance tests belong in the "scripts" directory.  Unit tests belong in the
"unit" directory.  Other tests are stored in the "other" directory.

Test output is stored in the output directory.
